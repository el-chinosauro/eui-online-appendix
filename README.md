## Services and Economic Development in Africa: Online Appendix

This repo hosts the [online appendix](https://github.com/el-chinosauro/services-africa/) for the recently published Report on Services and Economic Development in Africa by [Leonardo Baccini](https://sites.google.com/site/leonardobaccini/), [Matteo Fiorini](https://matteofiorini.com), [Bernard Hoekman](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=bernard-hoekman) and [Marco Sanfilippo](https://sites.google.com/view/marcosanfilippo/home) on which I have collaborated as a Research Associate in the [Global Governance Programme](https://globalgovernanceprogramme.eui.eu) at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/home).

In the Appendix, we explore sectoral and occupational dynamics at the second administrative level for 13 African countries included in the [IPUMS International](https://international.ipums.org/international/index.shtml) database. We provide scatterplots illustrating the movement of workers across sectors or occupations, barplots depicting the share of each sector or occupation on country totals, a series of maps which spatially connotate the dynamics of the 3 macro sectors, and replication code coupled with maps.
